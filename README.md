# VandyHacks-IX-BulletNote

## Inspiration
We conducted research and found that the most challenging activity in school for hearing-impaired students is taking notes. One of our group members also has experience with family members facing this issue.

## What it does
BulletNote builds structured notes based on speech recognition.

## How we built it
We built the web app in Flutter and it is hosted on Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning new technologies which include Flutter and Firebase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a functional and working app. We also completed all core goals and some stretch goals while forming new and valuable connections. It is our first hosted hackathon application for the team. We believe this idea can be taken further and make a change for good.

## What we learned
Apart from the new technologies, we gained a better understanding of how to completely design and develop a project from start to finish within a constricted time frame. Gained more experience working in a collaborative developer environment.

## What's next for BulletNote
First, we would like to implement complete text editing and allow the user to save their notes to their local machine or the cloud. Then, we would like to focus on getting iOS and Android versions available. From there, we would like to go even further and make this app available for hearing-impaired students at Vanderbilt, SIUE, and schools across the nation.
